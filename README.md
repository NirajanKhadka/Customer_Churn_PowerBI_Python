# üöÄ Customer Churn Prediction with Power BI & Python

## üìå Project Overview

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** project! The goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn (leave a service) based on their historical data. By using Python for data preprocessing and machine learning, and Power BI for data visualization, this project provides a comprehensive solution to monitor and predict customer churn.

The project helps organizations proactively identify churn risks and take action to retain valuable customers.

## üîç Key Features

- **Data Exploration & Analysis**: Use Python for a deep dive into the data, exploring relationships between customer demographics, transaction behaviors, and churn patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Build a churn prediction model using Scikit-learn to classify customers at risk of leaving.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Visualize churn predictions, trends, and other key metrics through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
- **Real-time Insights**: Provide actionable insights through Power BI, allowing businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and building the machine learning model.
- **Power BI**: For creating a dynamic, interactive dashboard to showcase predictions and insights.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing patterns in data and model results.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the churn prediction model.
  
## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anwarsan/credit-card-bank-churn). It contains data about bank customers, including demographics, transaction information, and whether the customer has churned or not. 

### Key Columns:

- `CLIENTNUM`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Attrition_Flag`: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).
- `Customer_Age`, `Gender`, `Income_Category`, `Card_Category`: Customer demographics.
- `Total_Trans_Amt`, `Total_Trans_Ct`: Transaction metrics for the customer.
- `Avg_Utilization_Ratio`, `Credit_Limit`: Key metrics for customer behavior.
